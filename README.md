# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for *Advent of Code 2024*, an annual coding challenge	event where a series of programming puzzles are released every day from December 1st to December 25th. I am using this opportunity to ***learn Python*** while solving these puzzles and improving my problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure 📂
The repository is organized as follows:
```
├── dayXX/
│   ├── part1.py    # Solution for Part 1 of Day XX
│   ├── part2.py    # Solution for Part 2 of Day XX
│   └── input.txt   # Puzzle input for Day XX
├── README.md       # This file
└── .gitignore        # Reusable utility functions (if any)
```

### Files and Folder
- `dayXX/`: Each folder corresponds to a specific day in the Advent of Code challenge.
	- `part1.py` and `part2.py`: Solutions for the day's puzzle.
	- `input.txt`: The input provided for the day's puzzle.
